# ZachPrice-randomImage

We were asked to create a program that can import and render an API to appear on the screen whilst taking use of useEffect and useState. I spent a lot of time searching for an API to use and that I could do quickly because I only had a certain amount of time. So what I chose for my project was an api from unsplash which when you reload the page it randomly generates a different image every time.
